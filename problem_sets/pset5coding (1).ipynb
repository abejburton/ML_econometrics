now use boosting to predict Log Salary in the `Hitters` data set.  \n","(a) Format the data appropriately for this analysis. Use 200 observations in your training set.  \n","(b) Perform boosting on the training set with 1,000 trees for a range of values of the shrinkage parameter λ. Produce a plot with different shrinkage values on the x-axis and the corresponding training set MSE on the y-axis. Add a curve with different shrinkage values on the x-axis and the corresponding test set MSE on the y-axis. The shrinkage parameter is often referred to as the learning rate   \n","(c) Compare the test MSE of boosting to the test MSE of two of the penalized regression approaches that we discussed  \n","(d) Which variables appear to be the most important predictors in the boosted model?  \n","(e) The default for base estimator is a Decision Tree with a maximum depth of 3. Is that the optimal depth? Justify your response.  \n","(f) Now that the boosting model is tuned, let's compare the results to bagging and random forests.
