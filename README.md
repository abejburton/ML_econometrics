Project, assignments, and coursework for BYU ECON 484 - Machine Learning for Economists. The course teaches the fundamentals of machine learning and the ways it is used in modern econometric research.

Problem set code is all written by me. Class work code is a mixture of my code and course materials written by Dr. Frandsen.

These jupyter notebooks give a great overiew of machine learning techniques and demonstrates how to use them in economic research for handling instrumental variables, feature generation, and heterogeneous treatment effects.
